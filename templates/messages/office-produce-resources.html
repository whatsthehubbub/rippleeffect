		<p>Oh no, look at what you’ve done. During your production work you ran into a risk, and because you didn’t safeguard it with a recovery barrier, the risk turned into a full-blown incident. That means you score no resources, no points, no nothing. Even your Goal Zero points are gone. This looks really terrible, even for a beginner.</p>

			<p>Oh man, that’s too bad! You didn’t get any resources. Like, at all! Maybe you should’ve talked to Abu and improved your production quality first? Or maybe you’re just out of luck?</p>

				<p>Well done! You got a resource. Your team will be so happy you’re on their side! Now, as much as I’d like to encourage you to keep producin’, remember that every time you produce a resource, your production quality will go down. I think the scientific phrase for that is ‘entropy’. So you have to constantly work on improving your production quality, too. But that’s really Abu’s department.</p>

				<p>This is incredible! Look at all the resources! If this doesn’t make your team members throw you a party, I don’t know what will!
