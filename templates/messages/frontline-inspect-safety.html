		<p>Your safety is magnificent. Couldn’t be better. Although, I have to remind you that I can only inspect about half of your safety. This is not nearly enough if you ask me, but you’ll have to deal with it. It’s just the nature of this business that we can never eliminate all risk, even if it seems like things are just excellent.</p>

		<p>Your safety looks pretty solid. Although, I have to remind you that I can only inspect about half of it. This is not nearly enough if you ask me, but you’ll have to deal with it. Now, is it safe enough to start production? Ultimately, that’s up to you.</p>

		<p>Your safety seems to be pretty average. Of course, I have to remind you that I can only inspect about half of it. This is not nearly enough if you ask me, but you’ll have to deal with it. Now, is it safe enough to start production? Ultimately, that’s up to you.</p>
