        <p>I can’t inspect your team member's safety as well as I’m used to. Here are the results… I advise you not to draw too many conclusions from this… it's fragmentary information at best.</p>

                <p>Your team member's safety is magnificent. Couldn’t be better. Perhaps it's obvious, but I should remind you that I can only take a random sample of about half the safety. This is not nearly enough if you ask me, but you’ll have to deal with it. It’s just the nature of this business that we can never eliminate all risk.</p>
