		<p>Elin: The safety is magnificent. Couldn’t be better. Perhaps it's obvious, but I should remind you that I can only take a random sample of about half the safety. This is not nearly enough if you ask me, but you’ll have to deal with it. It’s just the nature of this business that we can never eliminate all risk, even if it seems like things are excellent.</p>
