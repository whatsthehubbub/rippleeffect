<p>You’ve formed a team, so now it’s time to start Ripple Effect. In the role of an office player, you work with four assistants who'll help you get started at your station.</p>

<p>Mei: Hi there! Nice to meet you, my name is Mei. The goal of you and your team is to produce as many resources as you can. Why? Because they’ll give you points! Each team member has his or her own station, but your score is shared. So what are you waiting for? If you’re smart and persistent, the world is at your feet!</p>

<p>Abu: To be precise, the amount of resources you end up with depends on your production quality. If you want, I can inspect or improve this for you. Please be aware that you have a limited amount of actions per day, that’s shared by the entire team. Also consider that your production quality will drop every time you produce resources. And before I forget it... I’m Abu. I’m sure we’ll talk again soon.</p>

<p>Harry: Not so fast! Resources, points... it’s all nice and dandy, but nothing comes before safety. Name’s Harry, by the way. I’ve been doing this for thirty years, so I know what I’m talking about. Whenever you try to produce resources, you may run into risks. And if you don’t place recovery barriers beforehand, risks turn into full-blown incidents. The longer you prevent this, the higher the Goal Zero counter will climb!</p>

<p>Elin: It’s also possible to work on your safety in the long run. Better to prevent than to cure, right? You can come to me, Elin, to inspect or improve your safety. If you invest in this, I’m pretty positive that the future of you and your team will be bright. Good luck!</p>
