		<p>Your safety is magnificent. Couldn’t be better. Perhaps it's obvious, but I should remind you that I can only take a random sample of about half your safety. This is not nearly enough if you ask me, but you’ll have to deal with it. It’s just the nature of this business that we can never eliminate all risk, even if it seems like things are excellent.</p>

		<p>Your safety looks pretty solid. Perhaps it's obvious, but I should remind you that I can only take a random sample of about half your safety. This is not nearly enough if you ask me, but you’ll have to deal with it. Now, is it safe enough to start production? Ultimately, that’s up to you.</p>
